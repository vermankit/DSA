# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## Introduction

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** are fundamental concepts in computer science that focus on organizing data efficiently and solving computational problems effectively. 

### Data Structures
A **Data Structure** is a systematic way to store, organize, and manipulate data. Choosing the right data structure can dramatically affect the performance of algorithms. Key types of data structures include:

- **Arrays**: A collection of elements, stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists**: A linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next.
- **Stacks**: Follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queues**: Follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Trees**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes connected by edges, used to model pairwise relations.
- **Hash Tables**: Maps keys to values, offering fast lookups.

### Algorithms
An **Algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. Algorithms can be designed and optimized based on the data structures they manipulate. Key types of algorithms include:

- **Searching Algorithms**: Techniques to retrieve data from structures (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search).
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Arranging data in a particular order (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking down complex problems into simpler overlapping subproblems.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Making the best choice at each step to ensure an optimal solution.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Solving problems related to graphs (e.g., Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Breadth-First Search).

### Importance of DSA
Mastering DSA is crucial for:
- **Efficiency**: Writing efficient code that scales well with large datasets.
- **Problem Solving**: Applying the right techniques to solve computational problems.
- **Technical Interviews**: Many technical interviews focus heavily on DSA concepts.
